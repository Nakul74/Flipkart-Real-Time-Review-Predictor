Perfect product!,Worth it If you think to buy a tws then it is a best option light weight easy to carry I'm Happy From This.,5.0
Just okay,Good and well but still some batter time improved it will be good and I have a small fear that these buds or not fitting properly some times and may fall down that is a draw back.,3.0
Not recommended at all,"As they rightly say about Chinese Products: Chala Toh Chand Tak; Nahi Toh Raat Tak.Review after a month of using this product:Sound Quality Is good, above average I would call it.Easy to pair and connect.Like the fit, fits perfect in your ears.Issues: 1.

Just okay,"I am writing this review after using this product for more than 4 months now. ~Sound quality ( bass ) is good but not great. If you are a bass lover buy local earphones, they provide more bass than this product. Overall, sound quality is good.~Voice calls via Bluetooth is not at all impressive. If you are at a quiet place you can expect these to work just fine but if you are at public place don't even try to talk via these ear buds.~ Design is great. I love the design, fits well in ears an...",3.0

Good quality product,"First of all, size of the product is very small and handy, it can easily fit in your pocket. Battery backup is good as of now.Call quality is average, not expecting more...Sound quality is good for bass lovers, but not crispy. I'm using sony Headset (wired) while compared it's average.Usb type c is missing but not a issue.Interfaces - touch controls are average. Overall your budget is 1500 to 2000 consider to buy.",4.0

Does the job,"I read many negative reviews and few positive reviews about these earpods and took a chance to buy it for the real experience. I got it delivered by flipkart within 3-4 days after ordering. I unboxed it as soon as I got them, it was way to simple and easy to connect with your phone and laptop. After getting plugged in with these Realme Buds Q I realised that the sound quality was not that good if you are a music lover, though the quality of sound was clear it lacked in bass  and high music. ...",3.0
Classy product,Bass is not that much good . But the quality of vocals and loudness is absolutely fabulous .Although i face some connectivity problems with the left bud sometimes but overall a good purchase .pretty much much happy with my decision,5.0

Worst experience ever!,"Its not good deal. Sound Quality , Bass is all good but battery backup after 7 , is too bad. Charge full but when you started using , its battery down to immediately withing 30 second to 1 minutes.It's better then wired bluetooth as like Boat  and other  indian Brand.",1.0
Great product,Bought them in 1499 20 days ago...battery is 2 hrs for songs 1.5 hrs for call for a single bud. But the box can fully charge them in 30 minutes so no problem ..mic connectivity during call is also very good seems like hd calling but for a better experience you may require a calm place. Overall with brand support like real me one can buy blindfull,5.0
Just okay,The product is best and sound quality also best and beti so nice range also nice disadvantages after 7 days the right earbud will not work it will work but charging will not support you should clean the box and you should keep the charging and it works you don't think that the right earbud is not working to be working but it won't get charged through you should clean one time and you will do charge means you will get charged Atlas I control my speech by saying that the real world so nice name...,3.0

Classy product,The bass is extraordinary...you can never get this level of bass in any other TWS...I have also used Jabra elite & trust me realme buds Q can easily beat it...the pairing of the buds is so quick that you just have to take out the bus and it will connect within a second...if you want a TWS under 4k then you can go for it without a second though,5.0

Worth the money,It's pretty good for it's price range. However there are times when working out that during a call or while a song is playing a bit of it would be skipped due to my movements. It's not enough times for it to be annoying or for long enough for you to lose track of what someone is saying it is a possibility though. If your not using them while working out then it's perfectly fine.,4.0
Just okay,Product is good but touch control is annoying,3.0
Utterly Disappointed,"Everything was good in this  product but after using for 5 month, issue began when i kept buds in box they still connect to my Mobile i have to put pressure on the box to disconnect it, And i went to service center they told everything is perfect they denied the replacement.

Build quality is good. All in all i would say is the tws ear buds are still not nearly as good as their wired counterparts.

Really Nice,This TWS is really a great product under 2000. It's bass and sound quality is outstanding. Phone calling is also good. Every bass..u can feel . But if you want to buy this for gaming..like PUBG.. COD..then it is not good. Though it has 119ms letency...but the sound is delayed. Overall this product is great for listening music..or other games where sounds are not so important. It has an outstanding battery backup.. approximately 4 hrs...and with the case..24 hrs(my use).,4.0

Terrific purchase,Been Using This Product Since 5 Months And I Am In Love With It . The Bass On These Are More Than The Bass On Some High End Over Ear Headphones . Battry Life Is Pretty Good You Could Probably Use This For 2 Weeks If You Keep The Volume At 50 Percent . You Can Also Use This As A Monopod . The Call Quality Is Outstanding . I Recommend Everyone This Product If You Are Looking For The Best TWS Under 1500 Rupees,5.0
Horrible,I think its one of the worst ear buds bluetooth headset and I tried to retun this product but its been rejected and they said my return policy is end. Flipkart is making fool to customers now and can't trust on flipkart anymore,1.0

Good,Sound is good at this price. You have to listen on higher volume. Bass is good. Battery life is what they promise. Problem - it lags both in video player & in PUBG.                  For video u can adjust the lag from the player but for   PUBG it's a GREAT DISADVANTAGE.Make ur choice based on the purpose.,3.0
